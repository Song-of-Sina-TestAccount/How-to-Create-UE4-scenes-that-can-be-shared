# How-to-Create-UE4-scenes-that-can-be-shared
This is a detailed instructions on how to create UE4 scenes which can be uploaded to Github and shared wth others.

## Note:
For now this only works for brand new UE4 scenes not pre-existing ones with location folders not already connected to a repository. If you haven't already pushed your own branch to 'Clone_UE4Repo_Test1' repository then do so before attempting this.

## Instructions:
: Start by creating a new repo on Github
: Clone it down onto your local machine (computer)
## Important step
: Open UE4 and create a new project. Doing so you will have to select where to save the newly created project this will be the 'Locating folder' where you mush select the folder where just you cloned down your repository to. This links up your new UE4 project to the repo via your Github Desktop.
: Edit and change your new UE4 project and once your ready to upload to Github, save your project.
: Check Github Desktop and all your files changed will be displayed on the left, add a Commit title and a comprehensive description of all changes you made.
: Push to Origin (because you just created your repo earlier it has no files. This current save of your UE4 project has become your master branch (maybe re-explain pushing and pulling origin, master branch again)
